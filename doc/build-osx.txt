See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Dogecoin-QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7, 10.9 intel.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer. XCode should be available on your OS X
install DVD, but if not, you can get the current version from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
or by running `xcode-select --install` if you are using Mac OSX 10.9+

  git clone https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin

* Installing dependencies, MacPorts users (http://www.macports.org/):

  brew install boost berkeley-db4 openssl miniupnpc

  (Untested) Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
