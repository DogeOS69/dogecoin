How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Dogecoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `dogecoind`/`dogecoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Dogecoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Dogecoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Dogecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Dogecoin Core on
unsupported systems.

From Dogecoin Core 1.21.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no
longer supported. Additionally, Dogecoin Core does not yet change appearance
when macOS "dark mode" is activated.
